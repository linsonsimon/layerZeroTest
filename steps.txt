1) Deploy the LayerZero.sol file on the first chain (goreli) with the layerZero Endpoint contract Address as the constructor
2) change the network to second chain (sepolia) and deplo the same contract with the LayerZero endpoint contract Address of this chain
3) copy the address of the second contract we just deployed and pass it as a parameter to the first contract's "trustAddress" method and execute that method
4) copy address of the first contract and pass it as a paramter to the "trustAddress" method in the second contract
5) go to the first contract and execute a method "send" and pass some native tokens (12345678gwei) 

the message sending will take several minutes
switch the chain according to which contract you are intracting with
